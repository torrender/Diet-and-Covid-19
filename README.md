# Diet-and-Covid-19

The dataset I used was form _COVID-19 Healthy Diet Dataset_ by Maria Ren. Most of the variable had percent of what people eat along with the affects of Covid 19 on poplation. Wanted to see if i could Linear Regression to see which of the food groups had more of an affect on Covird. 

I used Shapior test to see if the dataset had normal distribution. All the variable had a p-value below .05 which means that we can't use Linear Regression. I did try it out to see what the result would be. The mutiple R-suared had .4675 and Aujusted R-squared of .3881.
